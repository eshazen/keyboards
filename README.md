# Keyboard project(s)

Working on a new daily driver.  Like the "80%" style which is similar
to 60% but with a function key row.

## Tools:

* [KLE](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)
* [Plate & Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/) (from [github](https://github.com/vladantrhlik/Keyboard_case_generator?tab=readme-ov-file))
* [PCB video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u13yRbBiRYM&t=10s)
* [Case video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIIr19TdidY)
* [Building Keyboards with Lasers](https://kbd.news/Building-keyboards-with-lasers-2208.html)
* [Keyboard University](https://www.keyboard.university/)
* [Pro Micro up to 100 pins](https://golem.hu/guide/pro-micro/)

Starting to investigate QMK.  For example the "handwired/hwpm87"n has 87 keys and uses a pro micro with extra 
pins soldered.  Seems promising.
